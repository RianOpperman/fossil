Recommended:
	-ffreestanding
		Lets compiler know it is building a kernel instead of user-space program
	-mno-red-zone
		Interrupts can corrupt the stack, so we don't have a red zone anymore

When linking use these options:
	- nostdlib
		Specify we won't have a standard lib on target
	- lgcc
		Link our own libgcc
